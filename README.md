# UAV-assisted-Mobile-Edge-Computing-with-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Methods

This repository contains the code for the training and the environment of a multi-agent edge-computing framework involving User Systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Edge Devices), and a Satellite.

The Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms of Dueling Double DQN, Prioritized DQN, and Policy Gradient - Softmax have been used in this project to minimize the time latency of processing and optimize the energy consumption of the UAVs.
